Experimental Setup

Data Pre-processing: The only pre-processing step applied to the input images was resizing them to a resolution of 640×640. No other pre-processing techniques were used.
Dataset Split: The dataset was randomly split into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8 : 1 : 1. A fixed random seed of 42 was used to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
